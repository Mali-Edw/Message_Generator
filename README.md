# Random Message Generator with ASCII Art Faces
This project is a simple JavaScript-based random message generator that combines text or ASCII art faces to create cohesive messages.

## Features
* Generates random messages using text or ASCII art components
* Text components are divided into beginnings, middles, and ends
* ASCII art faces are created by combining beginning, middle, and end components
* Easy customization of message components
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-message-generator.git```
2. Use the generator in a JavaScript environment.
3. Call the generateRandomMessage() function to generate a random message:
```console.log(generateRandomMessage());```

## Customization
You can customize the text components and ASCII art faces by modifying the arrays in the script.js file. Make sure to maintain the same number of characters in each line of the ASCII art components to avoid distortion.
